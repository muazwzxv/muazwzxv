### Hi there 👋
🌱 Just a tech enthusiast here

Currently leaning towards Backend development, Sytstem design and architecture and databases. I'm a curious person and It will bring me pleasure to be able to understand sophisticated concepts let alone implementing it myself. A noob in infosec, I'm on it, I'll update this when im no longer a script kiddie on htb
